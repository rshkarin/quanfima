# We begin by creating the data we want to render.
# For this tutorial, we create a 3D-image containing three overlaping cubes. 
# This data can of course easily be replaced by data from a medical CT-scan or anything else three dimensional.
# The only limit is that the data must be reduced to unsigned 8 bit or 16 bit integers.

# For VTK to be able to use the data, it must be stored as a VTK-image. This can be done by the vtkImageImport-class which
# imports raw data and stores it.

# The preaviusly created array is converted to a string of chars and imported.
data_string = data_matrix.tostring()

# The type of the newly imported data is set to unsigned char (uint8)
dataImporter.SetDataScalarTypeToUnsignedChar()
# Because the data that is imported only contains an intensity value (it isnt RGB-coded or someting similar), the importer
# must be told this is the case.
dataImporter.SetNumberOfScalarComponents(1)
# The following two functions describe how the data is stored and the dimensions of the array it is stored in. For this
# simple case, all axes are of length 75 and begins with the first element. For other data, this is probably not the case.
# I have to admit however, that I honestly dont know the difference between SetDataExtent() and SetWholeExtent() although
# VTK complains if not both are used.

# to be of the colors red green and blue.

# The preavius two classes stored properties. Because we want to apply these properties to the volume we want to render,
# we have to store them in a class that stores volume prpoperties.

# This class describes how the volume is rendered (through ray tracing).

# The class vtkVolume is used to pair the preaviusly declared volume as well as the properties to be used when rendering that volume.
